# distributed-search-pro
A distributed, high-concurrency search navigation engine built from the ground up. This system combines a custom **Weighted Ternary Search Tree (TST)** with the **Raft Consensus Protocol** to provide ultra-low latency searches (0.028μs) and 100% data consistency across a multi-node cluster.
